![alt text](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/multilayerperceptron_network.png)
## What's unique ?
The Neural Network has been built in such a way that any number of hidden layers, any number of neurons in hidden layers, any number of features and classes can be added.

## About Repository
This repository contains implementation of MLP multiClass Classifier from sratch.
The code is written for Python3.   
      
The program uses only numpy library for implementation. The scratch model has been compared with other models from scipy package.   
   
Dataset Used : IRIS dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)   
Accuracy score: 91%   
   
Bug reports are welcome, and you should feel free to fork and modify the code.
